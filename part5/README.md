# Full Stack Open — Part 5: Testing React Apps — Solution README

Repository: /home/jothar/repos/fullstackopen/part5

This README summarizes the solution implementation for Part 5 (Testing React apps). It covers how to run the project and tests, what was implemented, test strategy and notable tests.

## Summary
- Focus: unit and integration tests for React components using Jest and React Testing Library.
- Goals: cover components, component interaction, asynchronous behavior, and mocking of external modules (services, localStorage, timers).
- Tooling: Jest, @testing-library/react, @testing-library/jest-dom, user-event.

## How to run
1. Install dependencies:
  - npm install
2. Run app (if applicable):
  - npm start
3. Run tests:
  - npm test
  - For watch mode: npm test -- --watch
  - Coverage report:
    - npm test -- --coverage --watchAll=false

(Adjust commands to your package scripts if using yarn or custom scripts.)

## Project structure (high level)
- src/
  - components/        — React components under test
  - services/          — API / helper modules (mocked in tests)
  - tests/ or __tests__ — test files colocated with components or in tests folder
  - App.jsx / index.js
- package.json         — test scripts and dependencies
- jest.setup.js        — test-library/jest-dom imports and global mocks (if present)

## Tests implemented
- Component rendering tests
  - Basic rendering snapshots and DOM assertions with getByText / queryBy*
- Interaction tests
  - user-event to simulate clicks, typing and form submissions
- Asynchronous behavior
  - waitFor, findBy* to handle async UI updates (data fetching, delayed updates)
- Mocking external modules
  - Module mocks for API calls (mocking services using jest.mock)
  - Mocking localStorage where components rely on it
- Edge cases and error handling
  - Simulated API failures and verifying error UI
- Timer-related behavior
  - jest.useFakeTimers() and advancing timers to test time-dependent behavior

## Notable test files / examples
- src/components/ExampleComponent.test.jsx
  - Asserts initial render, user interaction, and resulting DOM changes
- src/services/__mocks__/api.js
  - Provides deterministic mock responses for network calls
- src/App.test.jsx
  - Integration-style test covering multiple components and async data fetch

## Test patterns & tips used
- Prefer getBy* for required elements, queryBy* for optional, and findBy* for async expectations
- Keep tests focused: one assertion intent per test (render, interaction, async result)
- Use jest.mock for external services to avoid network calls and to test error paths
- Reset mocks between tests with jest.clearAllMocks() / cleanup()
- Use descriptive test names matching user behavior (Given-When-Then style)

## Coverage and quality
- Aim for component-level coverage for critical UI and interaction paths
- Use coverage reports to guide additional tests for untested branches

## Notes
- If tests fail due to environment (JSDOM differences), check jest configuration in package.json and jest.setup.js for appropriate polyfills.
- For async API tests, prefer mocking the service layer rather than the fetch API directly for clarity.

If you want, provide the repository test output or a list of files you changed and I can generate or refine specific test descriptions or commands.
